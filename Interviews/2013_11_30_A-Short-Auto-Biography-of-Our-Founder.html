	<article class="fullArticle">
    	<p>Hello, my name is Martino Sinatra Henderson, Sr. and this is me. I grew up in Chicago, Illinois where I was raised by my working class Mother and Step-Father. I never got to know my biological father and never really got to miss him either. My step-father has been there for me since I was one year old, in other words before I could remember. I was raised in a house full of adults and there were not many children in the neighborhood where I lived. My brother was not born until after I turned five years old. In short I grew up very mature for my age and learned to be independent very early. My parents allowed me to be free to explore my curiosities without the constant overview or tether to their hips. I enjoyed horror movies at a very young age and did not scare very easily, or perhaps I enjoyed the feeling of being afraid because there was not much ease to worry about in my early life.</p>
        
        <p>For as long as I can remember I have always been curious about electronics and how they worked. I would take apart just about everything that had a screw in it and I would not get into trouble for doing so. This is when my fascination with computers began to develop. When I was about seven years old my Uncle was able to get a lot of old computers through his moving company. The law firm he was moving allowed them to have the computers for recycling and a discount on the services rather than pay extra for moving them to another location where they were going to be replaced with new equipment. I had to learn how to get these computers working without any prior knowledge of what to do with them. I learned to install and use DOS, then Windows, and eventually setting up local networks.</p>
        
        <p>My early experience was the catalyst to landing me some great paying jobs in the late 90s while I was in college studying to get a degree in Software development. While in school I was working full time providing desktop support for a few companies like Dell, and Accenture as an independent contractor and technology consultant. By the time I was 19 years old I had been working in IT for over a year and I had made a lot of money. So much so that I did not believe it was worth the effort to pay to get a degree in CIS considering I’ve already been working in the field and making good money doing it. So I dropped out of college and pursued my career.</p>
        
        <p>I did pretty well for myself, especially early on but I have always felt that I should have stayed in school and concentrated more on software engineering because that is the area I have always wanted to migrate towards. However, working with people is something I also enjoy. Not surprisingly, my upbringing; I was an only child for most of my early childhood, I was the only child close to my age in my neighborhood until I was in the eighth grade, and the fact that I grew up in a time when children were not allowed to participate in adult conversations (The saying “A child is to be seen and not heard” comes to mind), made me a very shy person. I was able to overcome those traits and become a confident and outgoing person; at least I learned to fake it very well.</p>
        
        <p>I’ve worked for companies like Dell and Accenture (as I mentioned), IBM, Apple, Pearson Education, Ogilvy & Mather, the Berkley School District, Northwestern University, Playboy Enterprises, and Publicis Groupe. I have been placed in charge of Daily IT support for almost all of those companies, and been given increasingly more and more responsibilities. Technically I should never have gotten any of the jobs I’ve had because I have no real proof that I can do the work other than my resume, in fact my previous two position I have received based solely on my resume. After an initial phone interview I was offered the position. Even with my relative success I still had this nagging feeling to go back to school. So last year I decided to go back to complete my degree and to study software engineering.</p>
        
        <p>I am glad that I decided to go back to school because the job I just started in September at Argonne National Laboratory in the Mathematics and Computer Sciences department, nearly all of my users are computer scientist doing research and much of it involves writing code. Since programming has stayed a hobby, but nothing I seriously worked on until the past few months I stayed marginally in practice but even a little knowledge in the subject can go a long way towards assisting and supporting a user.</p>
        
        <p>This is why I am creating DigitalXIII.com. I wanted to create a place where technology people in IT can go to for the latest in new technology and industry techniques. We will have interviews from people just like you in our tech corner. If you’re having trouble getting an issue resolved, our other readers may be able to help in the forums. My favorite part of the site is our in-depth review section. This is where we get to play with all the latest gadgets and tech toys and tell people it is for work. I really hope you like the site and if you have any suggestions on how to make it a better place for your technology needs, feel free to let us know.</p>

                <br /><hr /><p>The XFX 7970R Double Dissipation Black with AMD Radeon HD 7970 Gigahertz Edition Graphics Processing is quite a mouthful but you will have no problems spilling anything in there while your jaw is on the floor. Mind blowing graphics capability and frame rates are no longer a compromise when this latest GPU from AMD is installed into your gaming system.

             <p>
        XFX decided to stick with the stock clocking and setting with their interpretation of the Radeon HD 7970 Gigahertz edition GPU from AMD, and there is no immediate need to mess with what the engineers threw into this card. Not to outdone by Nvidia when they released the 670 only six months after the original Radeon HD 7970 was announced. AMD quickly responded with the 7970 GHz edition with ups the GPU processing to 1005MHz from 950MHz making it the first production GPU to clock over 1GHz.
             </p>
             <p> 
        Most manufactures would have been satisfied with that accomplishment but AMD took things one step further by not only increasing the amount of RAM from 1.5 GB to 3GB and increasing the RAM clock speed from 1600MHz to 1866MHz. All this beefing up leads to the 7970 GHz edition becoming the first GPU... <a href="reviews.html">Read more</a></p>

I would take apart just about everything that had a screw in it and I would not get into trouble for doing so. This is when my fascination with computers began to develop. When I was about seven years old my Uncle was able to get a lot of old computers through his moving company. The law firm he was moving allowed them to have the computers for recycling and a discount on the services rather than pay extra for moving them to another location where they were going to be replaced with new equipment. I had to learn how to get these computers working without any prior knowledge of what to do with them. I learned to install and use DOS, then Windows, and eventually setting up local networks... <a href="Interviews/2013_11_30_A-Short-Auto-Biography-of-Our-Founder.html">Read more</a></p>
